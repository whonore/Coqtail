# Change Log

## Unreleased ([master])

### Fixed
- Recognize `.` followed by a tab as a sentence ending.
  (PR #234)
- Don't abort if only warnings are printed to `stderr`.
  Include Coqtop `stderr` in the error message for `coqtail#start`.
  (PR #226)

## [1.5.0]

### Added
- `g:coqtail_coq_path` defaults to `$COQBIN` if it is set.
  (PR #219)

### Fixed
- Jumping to a definition with `:CoqGotoDef` or `:tag` commands works correctly
  with identifiers that include `'` (a single quote).
  (PR #218)
- Coqtail chooses which `coq(ide)top(.opt)` to use in a more predictable way.
  It uses `$PATH` (or `g:coqtail_coq_path` if it is set) to find `coqc` (or
  `g:coqtail_coq_prog` if it is set) and check its version.
  It then looks for `coqtop` or `coqidetop` (or `g:coqtail_coq_path`) as
  appropriate in the same directory as `coqc`, taking possible prefixes (e.g.,
  `coq-prover.`) and extensions (e.g., `.opt`) into account.
  **BREAKING**: If you have multiple versions of Coq installed Coqtail may
  choose a different one than before.
  In particular, executables in the current directory are no longer considered
  by default.
  Set `g:coqtail_coq_path` explicitly if you rely on this behavior.
  (PR #216)

## [1.4.1]

### Added
- Spell checking in comments.
  (PR #215)

### Fixed
- Return when Coqtop prints to `stderr` instead of waiting on `stdout` indefinitely.
  (PR #214)
- Use case-sensitive search in indent function.
  (PR #210)
- Use `win_execute` when possible while refreshing highlighting to avoid
  changing windows, which broke certain plugins.
  (PR #208)
- Highlight `Existing Instances`.
  (PR #207)
- Detect when Coqtop crashes on `:CoqStart` and print the error message instead
  of hanging.
  (PR #205)
- Work around a NeoVim bug with `py3eval` that caused Coqtail to incorrectly
  detect a lack of Python 3 support.
  (PR #204)
- Display the "Requires Python 3" warning message even if `shortmess+=F` is set.
  (PR #204)

## [1.4.0]

### Removed
- Support for Python <3.6.
  See [YouCompleteMe] for help with building Vim with Python 3 support.
  If you are unable to upgrade to Python 3, use the [python2] branch.
  Nearly all of the changes to the code are internal cleanup so there should be
  no observable changes in behavior.
  Please [open an issue] to report any regressions.
  See [here](https://github.com/whonore/Coqtail/issues/159) for the full list of
  changes.
  (PR #188)

  mode while updating the Goal and Info panels.

- Correctly ignore `(*` and `*)` inside strings.
  (PR #193)
- Print Coq error messages when checking goals or rewinding.

- Support for Coq installed through Snap by checking for the `coq-prover.`

- Support for multiple `_CoqProject` files.
  **BREAKING**: renamed `g:coqtail_project_name` to `g:coqtail_project_names`
  and `b:coqtail_project_file` to `b:coqtail_project_files`.

### Added
- Support for NeoVim >=0.3.
  (PR #103)
- `b:coqtail_coq_prog`/`g:coqtail_coq_prog` configuration option to override the
  name of the Coq executable.
  (PR #119)

### Fixed
- Lowered priority of Coqtail-related highlighting (`CoqtailChecked`,
  `CoqtailSent`, `CoqtailError`) so they don't cover existing highlighting, e.g.
  from `'hlsearch'`.
  (PR #104)
- Only call `coqtail#stop` on `:quit` if it would close the last visible
  instance of the buffer.
  (PR #105)

  Begin using semantic (more or less) versioning.

### Removed
- Dependency on `vim` module in Python code.
