*coqtail.txt*	Interactive Coq Proofs in Vim

Author:  Wolf Honore
License: MIT (see LICENSE)

Coqtail provides an interface to Coqtop to enable interactive Coq proof
development. Coqtail uses a separate instance of Coqtop for each buffer, so
you can have multiple open Coq sessions and switch between them seamlessly
using standard Vim methods (e.g., the |argument-list| or |buffer-list|).

=============================
Starting and Stopping Coqtail				    *coqtail-start-stop*

					    *<leader>cc* *:CoqStart* *coqtail-start*
:CoqStart	or
<leader>cc		Start the plugin. Spawn Coqtop in the background and
			open two windows on the right of the screen for the
			Goal and Info panels.

					      *<leader>cq* *:CoqStop* *coqtail-stop*
:CoqStop	or
<leader>cq		Stop the plugin. Stop Coqtop and close the Goal and
			Info panels.

					*CTRL-C* *:CoqInterrupt* *coqtail-interrupt*
:CoqInterrupt	or
CTRL-C			Send SIGINT to Coqtop and clear any pending commands.

=================
Movement Commands					      *coqtail-movement*

					      *<leader>cj* *i_<leader>cj* *:CoqNext*
								  *coqtail-next*
:[count]CoqNext	or
[count]<leader>cj	Submit the next [count] sentences to Coqtop for
			checking. If successful, highlight the sentences and
			update the Goal and Info panels accordingly.
			Otherwise, highlight the error and display the error
			message in the Info panel.

			[count] default: 1.

					      *<leader>ck* *i_<leader>ck* *:CoqUndo*
								  *coqtail-undo*
:[count]CoqUndo	or
[count]<leader>ck	Rewind by [count] steps. Un-highlight the previous
			sentences and update the Goal and Info panels.

			[count] default: 1.

					    *<leader>cl* *i_<leader>cl* *:CoqToLine*
							       *coqtail-to-line*
:[count]CoqToLine or
[count]<leader>cl	Check/rewind all sentences up to the end of line
			[count]. If no [count] is given, use the cursor
			position instead. For example, given the line below,
			where '^' represents the cursor position, `:CoqToLine`
			will position the end of the checked section just
			after '1' whereas `:27CoqToLine` will put it after '2'. >
    line 27:	   Let x := 1.^Let y := 2.
<
					     *<leader>cT* *i_<leader>cT* *:CoqToTop*
								*coqtail-to-top*
:CoqToTop	or
<leader>cT		Rewind to the top of the file. Unlike `:1CoqToLine`
			it rewinds to the beginning of the line.

						      *<leader>cG* *:CoqJumpToEnd*
							   *coqtail-jump-to-end*
:CoqJumpToEnd	or
<leader>cG		Move the cursor to the end of the checked region. This
			does not move the checked region.

						    *<leader>cE* *:CoqJumpToError*
							 *coqtail-jump-to-error*
:CoqJumpToError	or
<leader>cE		Move the cursor to the start of the error region. This
			does not move the checked region.

				      *<leader>cgd* *:CoqGotoDef* *coqtail-goto-def*
:CoqGotoDef[!] {arg}
<leader>cgd		Populate the |quickfix| list with possible locations
			of the definition of a Coq term and try to jump to the
			first one. If jumping is impossible open the
			|quickfix-window| instead. The first version uses
			{arg}, while the second uses the term under the
			cursor. If 'tagfunc' is supported then the usual tag
			commands will also work (`:tag`, `CTRL-]`, etc).

===========
Coq Queries						       *coqtail-queries*

							    *:Coq* *coqtail-query*
:Coq {args}		Send an arbitrary query to Coqtop and write the
			response to the Info panel. Commands and mappings for
			the common queries are listed below.

						     *<leader>cs* *coqtail-search*
:Coq Search {arg}
<leader>cs		The first version uses {arg}, while the second uses the
			term under the cursor or the highlighted range in
			visual mode.

						      *<leader>ch* *coqtail-check*
:Coq Check {arg}
<leader>ch

						      *<leader>ca* *coqtail-about*
:Coq About {arg}
<leader>ca

						      *<leader>cp* *coqtail-print*
:Coq Print {arg}

						  *<leader>cr* *:CoqRestorePanels*
							*coqtail-restore-panels*
:CoqRestorePanels
<leader>cr		Re-open the Goal and Info panels in their original
			configuration.

						      *<leader>cgg* *:CoqGotoGoal*
						       *coqtail-goto-goal-start*
:[count]CoqGotoGoal
<count><leader>cgg	Scroll the Goal panel to the start of goal [count].
			Control the number of goal lines to display with
			`g:coqtail_goal_lines`.

			[count] default: 1.

						     *<leader>cgG* *:CoqGotoGoal!*
							 *coqtail-goto-goal-end*
:[count]CoqGotoGoal!
<count><leader>cgG	Same as `:CoqGotoGoal` but scroll to the end of the
			goal.

							   *]g* *:CoqGotoGoalNext*
						  *coqtail-goto-goal-next-start*
:CoqGotoGoalNext
]g			Scroll the Goal panel to the start of the next goal.

							  *]G* *:CoqGotoGoalNext!*

							      *coqtail-coq-prog*
g:coqtail_coq_prog
b:coqtail_coq_prog	The name of the Coq executable to run. If empty then

		    let b:coqtail_coq_prog = 'hoqidetop'
<
			Default: ''

				       *g:coqtail_goal-lines* *coqtail-goal-lines*

					     *b:coqtail_timeout* *coqtail-timeout*
b:coqtail_timeout	The time in seconds before interrupting Coqtop after
			issuing a command. A value of 0 disables the timeout.
			Coqtail can also be manually interrupted with
			`:CoqInterrupt`.

			Default: 0

				     *g:coqtail_project_names* *coq-project-files*
g:coqtail_project_names	The names of Coq project files to search for. The
			search begins in the current directory and proceeds
			upwards. If found, project files are parsed and passed
			as arguments to Coqtop by `:CoqStart`.

			Default: ['_CoqProject']

						       *b:coqtail_project_files*
b:coqtail_project_files	Paths to the Coq project files found during `:CoqStart`.

			Default: `g:coqtail_map_prefix`

					    *g:coqtail_nomap* *coqtail-no-mapping*
g:coqtail_nomap		If true then don't set any default mappings for
			Coqtail	commands. Specific mappings can also be
			overwritten by defining new mappings for the desired
			commands. The defaults will continue to be used for
			the rest.

			Default: 0

				    *g:coqtail_noimap* *coqtail-no-insert-mapping*
g:coqtail_noimap	If true then don't set insert-mode mappings for
			Coqtail	commands.

			Default: 0

				     *g:coqtail_match_shift* *coqtail-match-shift*
g:coqtail_match_shift	A multiple of 'shiftwidth' to indent lines after a
			match branch. Also applies to `Inductive` constructors.
			Note: This is does not affect the indentation of the
			line with `|` itself. For matches these are always
			aligned with the `match` keyword, and for `Inductive`
			(and related keywords) this is controlled by
			`g:coqtail_inductive_shift`.
			E.g. >
		    match b with
		    | true =>
		      1 (* g:coqtail_match_shift = 1 *)
		    | false =>
			2 (* g:coqtail_match_shift = 2 *)
		    end

		    Inductive X :=
		      | A :
			X (* g:coqtail_match_shift = 1 *)
		      | B :
			  X (* g:coqtail_match_shift = 2 *)
<
			Default: 2

			     *g:coqtail_inductive_shift* *coqtail-inductive-shift*
g:coqtail_inductive_shift
			A multiple of 'shiftwidth' to indent branches of an
			`Inductive` (and related keywords) constructor.

						*b:coqtail_auto_set_proof_diffs*
							   *coqtail-proof-diffs*
g:coqtail_auto_set_proof_diffs
b:coqtail_auto_set_proof_diffs
			The argument to automatically pass to `:Coq Set Diffs`
			on every new Coqtail session. For example, if
			`g:coqtail_auto_set_proof_diffs` is `'on'` then
			`:CoqStart` calls `:Coq Set Diffs "on"` immediately
			after launching Coqtop. The argument is ignored if it
			is set to `''` (the default) or if using a version of
			Coq that does not support proof diffs.
			Note: Changing this option after `:CoqStart` has no
			effect on the current proof. To manually toggle diffs
			mid-proof use `:Coq Set Diffs "{arg}"` where `{arg}`
			is `on`, `off`, or `removed`.

			Default: ''

=======================
Backwards Compatibility			       *coqtail-backwards-compatibility*


			       *g:coqtail_version_compat* *coqtail-version-compat*
g:coqtail_version_compat
			New versions of Coqtail should generally maintain
			backwards compatibility with old ones, but in cases
			where they do not the old behaviors can be enabled by
			including the correct version string in the
			`g:coqtail_version_compat` list. The table below lists
			the valid version strings and their effects.

			Default: []

Version	Effect~
						    *coqtail-version-compat-1.5*
'1.5'	Undo the changes to the default mappings made in v1.6.

=========
Debugging							 *coqtail-debug*

			       *<leader>cd* *:CoqToggleDebug* *coqtail-toggle-debug*
:CoqToggleDebug
<leader>cd		Enable or disable logging of debugging statements to a
			file. Enabling creates a temporary file and displays
			the name in the Info panel. The name is also stored in
			`b:coqtail_log_name`. Disabling and enabling again
			creates a new log file. Disabled initially.

					   *b:coqtail_log_name* *coqtail-log-name*
b:coqtail_log_name	The name of the debugging log file. Set automatically
			by enabling/disabling debugging with `:CoqToggleDebug`.

			Default: ''
